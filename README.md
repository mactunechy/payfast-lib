## Introduction

PayFast Express Handler Adapter is a lightweight library that simplifies the integration of PayFast payment gateway with your Node.js web applications built on Express.js. PayFast is a popular South African payment processor that allows merchants to accept payments online securely and conveniently.

**Key Features:**

- Seamless integration with Express.js: Easily incorporate PayFast payment handling into your existing Express application with minimal setup.
- Payment Verification: Simplify the process of verifying payment status, ensuring the security of your transactions.
- ITN (Instant Transaction Notification) Support: Receive and process ITN callbacks from PayFast for handling payment updates.
- Customizable Configuration: Configure the adapter based on your specific PayFast account settings and preferences.

Whether you're running an e-commerce platform or managing online donations, the PayFast Express Handler Adapter streamlines the payment process, allowing you to focus on delivering a great user experience.

**Note:** This library is not officially affiliated with PayFast. It serves as an independent, community-driven effort to simplify PayFast integration for developers working with Express.js.


[Continue to Installation](#installation)


## Installation
Go ahead and run the following command to insatll `payfast-lib` into you project

```bash
    npm install payfast-lib
```

## Configuration

- Import the handler config function from `payfast-lib`

```js
    import { configurePayfastExpressHandler } from 'payfast'  //ES6
    const { configurePayfastExpressHandler }  = require('payfast-lib')  // CommonJS
```


- Make sure an express application is already setup and `express.json()` middleware was already configured,
- The `express.json()` function is a built-in middleware function in Express. It parses incoming requests with JSON payloads

- You can configure the middleware buy adding the following line of code
  
```js
  app.use(express.json())
```
- Configure the payfast express handler by adding the following line of code

```js
  configurePayfastExpressHandler(app, {
    merchant_id: "{YOUR_MERCHANT_ID}",
    merchant_key: "{YOUR_MERCHANT_KEY}",
    return_url: "{YOUR_RETURN_URL}"
    cancel_url: "{YOUR_CANCEL_URL}",
    /**
     * Recieve instant payment notifications (IPNs) to this notify webhook. create the webbook on your.
     * This webhook will be called by payfast with the request payload as the details of the payment.
     */
    notify_url: "{YOUR_NOTIFY_URL}",
    env: "sandbox", // "prod" for your production environment
    passPhrase: "{YOUR_PAYFAST_PASSPHRASE}",
  });
```

__NOTE__ : you can get your on `merchant_id` and `merchant_key` after you create your own account. visit [payfast](https://payfast.io/)


## ITN webhook
- On payment completion, payfast sends a post request to the `notify_url`
- the webhook's payload contains useful information that you may want to save to you own database

### Example webhook
- here is an example of the webhook implementation

```js

  app.post('/api/payfast/notify', async (req, res) => {

    const fieldsArray = await request.formData();

    const data = {};

    fieldsArray.forEach((value, key) => {
      data[key] = value;
    });
    

    // Use the parsed data as needed ...

    return res.sendStatus(200)
  })

```

- The signature of the request payload to the webook: 

```js
     {
       m_payment_id: "2954323c-5c1a-4e1d-b021-036415241bb4",
       pf_payment_id: "1731271",
       payment_status: "COMPLETE",
       item_name: "",
       item_description: "",
       amount_gross: "",
       amount_fee: "",
       amount_net: "",
       custom_str1: "",
       custom_str2: "",
       custom_str3: "",
       custom_str4: "",
       custom_str5: "",
       custom_int1: "",
       custom_int2: "",
       custom_int3: "",
       custom_int4: "",
       custom_int5: "",
       name_first: "tina",
       name_last: "",
       email_address: "",
       merchant_id: "",
       signature: "",
    };
```

## Usage
- send a `POST` request to your application on the following endpoint
  `/api/payfast`

### payload: 

```json
    {
      "name_first": "{customer_name}",
      "name_last": "{customer_lastname}",
      "email_address": "{customer_email}",
      "amount": "{amount}",
      "item_name": "test1"
    }

```

- For the full list of possible options see [payfast docs](https://developers.payfast.co.za/docs#step_1_form_fields). for typescript users you can make use of the `PayfastPaymentProps` type


### Response:
```js
  {
    "uuid": "39cebeae-4a53-4f55-9ab2-1b9b958a2bcb",
    "return_url": "http://localhost:3000/return",
    "cancel_url": "http://localhost:3000/cancel"
  }
```

Use the response to render the the Payment form in your user interface using `Payfast` javascript bundle

add the following lines to your `index.html` 

```js
    <head>
      <script src="https://sandbox.payfast.co.za/onsite/engine.js" />
    </head>
```
__NOTE__: use `https://www.payfast.co.za/onsite/engine.js` for __production__ env refer to payfast docs


### Rendering the Payfast widget in your website

### Using React

```jsx
    const handlePayment = async (data) => {
      //assuming you react bundle is running on the same server as the backend

        const headers = new Headers();
        headers.append('Content-Type', 'application/json');

       const result = await fetch('/api/payfast', {
        method: "POST",
        headers,
        body: JSON.stringify({
          name_first: "Dellan",
          name_last: "Much",
          email_address: "d@testc.com",
          amount: "21",
          item_name:"test"

        })
       })

       const data = result.json()


      //Opening the payfast UI widget
      window.payfast_do_onsite_payment({
        uuid: data.uuid
        return_url: data.return_url
        cancel_url: data.cancel_url
      })

    }

```

## Next.js 13 support
Add a new payfast api route to your project by creating the following folder structure
```
app
└── api
    └── payfast
        └── route.ts

```
add the following lines of code to the `route.js`
```ts
import { nextPayfastHandler } from "payfast-lib";

export const POST = nextPayfastHandler({
  merchant_id: "{YOUR_MERCHANT_ID}",
  merchant_key: "{YOUR_MERCHANT_KEY}",
  return_url: "{YOUR_RETURN_URL}"
  cancel_url: "{YOUR_CANCEL_URL}",
  /**
   * Recieve instant payment notifications (IPNs) to this notify webhook. create the webbook on your.
   * This webhook will be called by payfast with the request payload as the details of the payment.
   */
  notify_url: "{YOUR_NOTIFY_URL}",
  env: "sandbox", // "prod" for your production environment
  passPhrase: "{YOUR_PAYFAST_PASSPHRASE}",
});

```

- send a `POST` request to your application on the following endpoint
  `/api/payfast`

### payload: 

```json
    {
      "name_first": "{customer_name}",
      "name_last": "{customer_lastname}",
